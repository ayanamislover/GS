Project Name:Exeter Checkers
Project Introduction:
Developed by Django, our app aims to enhance players' awareness of sustainability through a simulated reality version of games like Flying Chess or Monopoly. We encourage users to step outside, walk more, and reduce energy consumption. Through this interactive and enjoyable approach, we hope to inspire more people to actively engage in environmentally friendly behaviors.
