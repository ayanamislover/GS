It sets up a video element (<video>) to stream video from the user's camera.
It includes a button labeled "Take Photo" (<button id="snap">) which, when clicked, captures a frame from the video stream and displays it on an image element (<img id="takenPhoto">).
Another button labeled "Upload Photo" (<button id="uploadPhoto">) is provided to upload the captured photo to the server.
It includes an input field to store the user's nickname.
The JavaScript code:
Accesses the user's camera using navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia.
Defines event listeners for the "Take Photo" and "Upload Photo" buttons.
When the "Take Photo" button is clicked, it captures a frame from the video stream and displays it on the webpage.
When the "Upload Photo" button is clicked, it converts the captured photo to a data URL, creates a blob from it, and sends it to the server using a FormData object via a fetch request.
It also appends the user's nickname to the form data before uploading.
Finally, it provides a function (returnToGame()) to close the window when the "Back to the game" button is clicked.
